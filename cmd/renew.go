	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// renewCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	renewCmd.Flags().String("kubeconfig", "kubelet.conf", "The name of the kubeconfig file to renew certs in")
	renewCmd.Flags().String("output", "", "The name of the output file to write config to. Defaults to name of kubeconfig file.")
	renewCmd.Flags().String("root", ".", "The root directory under which the path to the k8s config can be found at etc/kubernetes")
	renewCmd.Flags().Int("expire", 12, "The number of months to set the certificate to expire in")
}
